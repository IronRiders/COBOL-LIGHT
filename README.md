# COBOL LIGHT

This is a version of the 2023 Charged Up code for Cobol without features needed for completion, but with some 
customizations for the freshmen fair. This should increase the stability of the code.

## LIGHTS SUBSYSTEM ONLY

This is for the freshmen fair and for the software curriculum. This branch has only the lights 
subsystem and does not contain anything else.
